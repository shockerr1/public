# LCPD Tracker 2.0, developed by Alex Lyashenko. 

### 1.0 - Who is this app for?
The app is for Australian lawyers and its sole purpose is to keep track of one's personal CPD progress throughout a year.



### 2.0 - Limitations.
LCPD Tracker does not track actual CPD dates - The CPD year runs from 1 April to 31 March the following year (as per lawsociety.com.au as of Nov 2020). The app does not have an alerting system to notify users when CPD year is about to end. The app is designed so that the user has flexibility in entering their data at their own pace.

As of November 2020 the app has no ability to attach files to CPD events (receipts from events, emails etc.) however since the app is still in its early stage of development such functionality may be added in the future.
